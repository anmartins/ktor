Structured project for ktor server.

# Folder structure

Every new feature  should be added to the features folder. Before adding a new folder see if any of the existing already satifies the category of the new feature. 

Every route should be added to the routing folder. If a route earns enough complexity, creating a new folder to accommodate  the requirements is a valid solution. Just dont't forget to add it under the route folder umbrella.

As this project is still a baby, it has no services folder, but it's something that will eventually appear.

## Updates

The updates to this project structure will appear as I advance in others projects. Sneak pick the rest if this gets older.
